# Phase 2 — The AI Audit: Bank Account
#
# This script was "written by AI." It has exactly 5 mistakes:
#   - 2 syntax errors  (Ruby won't even run until these are fixed)
#   - 3 logic flaws    (Ruby runs but produces wrong results)
#
# Your job: find all 5, add a comment above each bug, then fix them.
# Use this format for your comments:
#   # BUG [n]: [what is wrong] → FIX: [what it should be]
